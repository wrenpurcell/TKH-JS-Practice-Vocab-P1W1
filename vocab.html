      <h2>Git vs Github</h2>
      <article>Git is a version control system. It works by saving different versions of files as lines and various versions as additions or subtractions of those lines. This makes git very powerful for reverting back to previous versions, forking different branches and working on projects with multiple people and teams. Github on the other hand is just one of various online places to store repositories (or folders with code) that adds extra functionality to git.</article>

    <li>
      <h2>Github terms: push, pull, fork, clone, repository</h2>
      <h3>Push</h3>
      <article>To push is to upload your code and all files in a repository to the cloud.</article>
      <h3>Pull</h3>
      <article>To pull is to save changes from the cloud to your local repository.</article>
      <h3>Fork</h3>
      <article>To fork is to start a new branch off another branch. This means all new commits to the forked branch will not affect the original branch unless a pull request is made and committed.</article>
      <h3>Clone</h3>
      <article>To clone is to make a copy of a cloud based repository to your local system. You can then make changes and push to that cloud based repository.</article>
      <h3>Repository</h3>
      <article>A repository is a collection of files that are being tracked by a version control system like git.</article>
